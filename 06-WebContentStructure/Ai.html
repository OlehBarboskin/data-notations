    <h1>AI Definition</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development
        of computer systems that can perform tasks typically
        requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
        problem-solving, understanding natural language,
        recognizing patterns, and making decisions.</p>

    <h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>
        AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
        and techniques, such as machine learning, natural
        language processing, robotics, and computer vision.

    <p>Key Concepts in AI

        In relation to artificial intelligence,
        the following key concepts can be distinguished:
        
        Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI
        that allows systems to learn from data and improve
        over time without being explicitly programmed.
        Examples include recommendation systems (like
        Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.
        
        Natural Language Processing (NLP): A branch of AI
        focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret,
        and generate human language. Applications include voice
        assistants like Siri or Alexa, chatbots, and language
        translation systems.
        
        Computer Vision: Enables machines to interpret
        and make decisions based on visual data from the world,
        such as images and videos. It's widely used in facial
        recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging.
        
        Robotics: AI powers robots, giving them the ability
        to perform tasks autonomously, often in environments
        that are too dangerous or complex for humans.
        
        Expert Systems: AI-based systems designed to mimic
        human expertise in specific domains, such as medical
        diagnosis or financial decision-making.</p>
    <h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>AI is used as voice assistants. Siri, Google Assistant,
        and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
        commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to
        recommend products or shows based on your previous
        interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate
        roads and make driving decisions.</p>
    <h3>The Future of AI</h3>
    <p>AI continues to grow and impact various fields such as
        healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing.
        However, ethical considerations, such as job
        displacement, privacy concerns, and AI safety, are also
        key topics of discussion. The development of AI is
        likely to reshape many industries and aspects of daily
        life in the years to come.</p>
